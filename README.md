# Warning:
  - this is my first addon in Blender
  - addon still in development
  - animation will override existing keyframes
  - only one object is supported (I do not plan any mocap setup)
  - **the phone app does not exists yet.** The addon is being developed as term project and server side is being developed using Rasperry PI/Arduino and the app must wait. If you want to contribute contact me: czubaka111@gmail.com
